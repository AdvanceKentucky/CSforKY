  <h1>Kentucky Computer Science Pledge</h1>
  <p>Computer science drives job growth and innovation throughout our
    economy and society. Computing occupations are the number 1
    source of all new wages in the U.S. and make up over half of all
    projected new jobs in STEM fields, making Computer Science one of
    the most in-demand college degrees. And computing is used all
    around us and in virtually every field. Itâ€™s foundational knowledge
    that all students need. But computer science is marginalized
    throughout education. Only 45% of U.S. high schools teach any
    computer science courses and only 10% of STEM graduates study it.
    We need to improve access for all students, including groups who
    have traditionally been underrepresented.</p>


  <p>We believe that every K-12 Kentucky student should have the opportunity to learn computer science in school.</p>
  <p>Our mission is to make high-quality computer science an integral part of the educational experience of all K-12
    students and teachers and to support student pathways to college and career success.</p>
